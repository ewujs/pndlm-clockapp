/**
 * Renders 60 markers around the clock face to represent seconds or minute ticks.
 * 
 * Behavior:
 * - Uses Redux state `theme.mode` to adjust marker color depending on light, dark, or luxury themes.
 * - Renders 60 `<i>` elements inside a `<ul>`, each representing a second/minute marker.
 * - Every 5th marker (`i % 5 === 0`) is considered an **hour marker**, which can be styled differently.
 * - Markers are positioned evenly around the clock face based on a calculated percentage step.
 *
 * Variables:
 * - `count`: Number of markers to render (60 markers for full clock).
 * - `step`: Percentage of rotation between each marker (100% รท 60 = 1.666...% per marker).
 * - `marker`: Character/string used to render the visual tick (currently `'|'`).
 *
 * CSS:
 * - `percentage`: Defines where the marker is placed along the circumference.
 * - `isHourMark`: Boolean that allows hour markers (every 5th) to have special styling.
 *
 * @component
 * @returns {React.ReactElement} A styled unordered list containing clock face markers.
